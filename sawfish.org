* Shutdown/Reboot issue
  In ubuntu, click Shutdown/Reboot will not work. Those commands are called as 

: sudo reboot -r

  By default, you need to input password for sudo operations. To handle this:

: sudo visudo /etc/sudoers

add a line as:

: wenliang ALL = NOPASSWD : ALL

And this will fix the problem.

* DNS lost in VPN
  create a file /etc/bakdns.txt:
: nameserver 165.87.201.244
: nameserver 192.168.1.1

And modify /usr/local/bin/sawfish.start, add a line before /exec sawfish/:
: sudo cp /etc/bakdns.txt /etc/resolv.conf

* Make an IP not using VPN
  add the following line to openvpn.conf

: route 64.79.125.0 255.255.255.0 net_gateway 5

* My twitter setting
: (autoload 'twit "twittering-mode" nil t)
: (eval-after-load "twittering-mode"
:  '(progn
:     (setq twittering-use-master-password t)
:     (setq frame-title-format '("Twitter@Emacs"))
:     (twittering-icon-mode 1)))

* TODO I think it's better using W-S-num to shift a window to a workspace
  But it seems that it doesn't work.
* TODO Refine all the keybindings according to their types
* TODO A blog about the sawfish
